# ipa-keyboard
 
## Description
This is an ahk file that maps every standard IPA character onto a keyboard. Because of how many symbols there are, this requires overriding many more keys than a usual keyboard layout like the right control, alt, and shift keys. It also makes use of the numpad and keys like Insert, Scroll Lock, Page Up, etc. For keyboards that dont have a numpad, I have mapped some key combinations with Alt to the numpad. Most keyboards have special combinations to input keys like Insert, Scroll Lock, Page Up, etc. if they don't have buttons for them, so this might take some research for your specific computer. If not, feel free to edit the script directly, the format is pretty self explanatory.
